**📊 AdventureWorks Sales & Customer Analytics (Power BI)**

An end-to-end business intelligence project built using Power BI on the AdventureWorks dataset.
This project demonstrates my ability to model data, write advanced DAX, and convert raw data into business insights — not just dashboards.

**🔍 Project Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, product profitability, and regional trends while answering real business questions such as:

How is revenue and profit trending over time?

Who are the most valuable customers?

Which products drive revenue vs returns?

How close are we to monthly targets?

What happens to profit if prices change?

Which regions perform best?

This project is designed specifically for data analyst / BI analyst / Power BI developer interviews.
